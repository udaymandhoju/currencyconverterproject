        <h1>Evolution of Currency</h1>
        <p>In the olden days, there was no currency. People used to exchange things directly — this was called the barter system.</p>
        <p>For example, if a person had 1 kg of rice and wanted to buy 1 kg of tomatoes, he would go to someone who had tomatoes and offer rice in exchange. But if the tomato seller didn’t need rice, the exchange couldn’t happen. This was the main problem with the barter system — both people had to want what the other had.</p>
        <p>To solve this, currency was introduced. Now, the person with rice could sell it to someone who needed rice and get money in return. Then, he could take that money to the tomato seller, give the money, and buy the tomatoes. This made buying and selling much easier for everyone.
